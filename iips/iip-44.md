## 2.) Genre Analysis Document
### 1. Genre Categories
List all potential game genres considered vertically in the first column. This might include: RPG, FPS, MMORPG, Adventure, Racing, Horror, Simulation, Sports, etc.
### 2. Evaluation Criteria
Here are potential criteria the team could use to evaluate each genre along with any information included in the Market research Documentation:

- Market Size: Estimated number of players or revenue generated by games in this genre.
- Asset Reusability: The feasibility and impact of reusing current assets in this genre.
- Blockchain and code reuasability: Will we have to start coding from scratch or will it seamlessly cross over. 
- Blockchain Integration Potential: How well the genre can integrate with blockchain features like tokenization, smart contracts, etc.
- Development Timeline: Estimated time to develop a game in this genre.
- IP Enhancement: The potential of the genre to add value to your studio's Intellectual Property.
- Competition: Degree of saturation and competition in the market for this genre.
- Team's Experience: The current expertise your team has in this genre.
- ROI Potential: Estimated return on investment for developing a game in this genre.
- Player Base Overlap: Potential overlap with your current player base, indicating chances of cross-selling or up-selling.

### 3. Genre status
Once the preplanning documentations and genre information has been collected, Genres can be placed in 5 categories. Each of these categories represents the feasibility of developing a game in the specified genre. Some Genres do not garner the support by the team or have other stringent factors and will fall in the black category, while other Genres tick all the boxes and fall in the Green category as a result. Red, orange and Yellow are intermediate categories where the proposals are more and more feasible to be built. A game genre falls in a specific category if even one of their respective statements is true. For example: A game genre that garners the support of the team, can be developed with the current team members but costs an insurmountable amount of money falls in the category Black.

**Black category:** There are limitations that make this genre unviable:
- The studio is against building a game in this genre
- We would have to raise an amount of money that is not currently possible
- We are not sure how to even get the talent to make a game

**Red Category:** While not impossible, there are clear issues with the genre:
- The studio is not motivated by this genre
- We would need a significant amount of money (X-X)
- We would need to contract out a new studio for this game

**Orange Category:** There are definite points of concern to realize the genre:
- The studio is not significantly motivated by this genre
- We would need to raise a moderate amount of money to ensure development (X-X)
- We would need to hire a substantial amount of new talent to complete the game

**Yellow Category:** The genre has the team’s support but:
- We would need to raise a small amount of money to ensure development (X-X)
- We would need a few key hires to build the game

**Green Category:** The genre ticks all the boxes and makes for a viable next avenue of development:
- The team is motivated by this genre
- Developing the game is within our current budget
- We currently have the capabilities to develop the game.



## 3.) Game Pitch Process Flow
The way the DAO collects and evaluates proposals must be thorough and all encompassing. We aim to leverage our massive community for both ideation and selection process to best decide the future. It is important in a DAO that we are ensuring every stakeholder within has the opportunity to contribute. Before jumping into the process flow here are some definitions:

### Definitions:
- **Illuvium Game Pitch (IGP)** - A formal proposal submission for a specific game that includes the following (Templates and specific requirements will be provided by Epoch 9):
   - Illuvium Game Pitch Proposal (IGPP), White paper on concept
      - This is akin to an IIP and will be submitted to snapshot and voted on similarly if support is gained.
   - Pitch deck
   - Game Evaluation SpreadSheet
     - A subjective ranking report of key market research categories of the game pitch. These will be presented to the public and can be used as talking points for members of the DAO to support or debate metrics provided
   - A General Questionnaire Form
     - This will include various questions around the pitch as well as accepting terms and conditions around the submission of sponsored pitch 
- **Pitch Review Board (PRB)** - A special hearing where the IMC, select committee, and Studio team members will hear out IGP’s and will provide judgment on all pitches that have gained sufficient community sentiment. These meetings will be called at a select time(s) in the game development evolution where the team is close to being able to work on new IP. These meetings will be determined and initiated by an IMC Vote requiring a supermajority support.
- **Illuvium Pitch Jam (IPJ)** - A major hackathon-like event announced by the IMC when it is time to craft, collect, and review IGP’s. Once announced, anyone who sponsors a new IGP can be opted to be placed in the IPJ pool instead of a regular Illuvium Game Pitch Forum. They will follow a different review process as denoted below compared to ongoing pitches that are sponsored throughout the year. Sponsors who participate in the event may have the opportunity to earn rewards based on the success of their proposal. These events can be highly marketable and can be another way to bring attention to the DAO.
   - Rewards could include: POAP, Cosmetic, Promotional, and various game NFTs, ILV or ETH, and potentially more. 
   - These events would be announced with a minimum of a 1 month leadway and will be followed by a Pitch Review Board. In this announcement an updated Genre Analysis Document will be provided to the DAO to help direct the community towards brainstorming what has the highest chance of being selected and provide the best opportunity for illuvium. Also acting as a guideline for the IMC/committee during the review board.

 
The proposed process will be split into two submission categories to ensure we are actively hearing out game pitches throughout the year as well as highly concentrated events that will motivate the entire community and possibly other studios within the industry to participate and innovate the next generation of top Tier illuvium IP. 

## Ongoing Pitch Intake Process:

1. New Forum is made “Illuvium Game Pitches” within the discord and/or the eventual governance website. Where community, team members, and/or external organizations can submit a proposal.
2. The Illuvium Community Council then vets that all documentation is complete and meets requirements.
3. Once approved The Sponsor(s) can then request a town hall to pitch the IGP to the community. The Governance Admin(if established) will work with Community management and the sponsor to find a date and time within a minimum of 7 days for the town hall. 
   - They would have X mins Present, X mins Q and A
4. The proposal would then need to receive over X support over x days
5. The pitch Proposal would then be voted on at the Illuvium community council 
   - If it passes Illuvium Community Council it will be placed in a holding pool till a Pitch Review Board is called.
   - If it is rejected the sponsor can not submit a proposal of the same genre for the next three months. 

## Illuvium Pitch Jam Process:
1. An Illuvium Pitch Jam is announced and suggested Genre analysis Document is provided to the public.
2. Sponsors would have a minimum of 1 month to submit proposals to the IPJ pool that would not be publicly visible at first. 
   - Illuvium Community Council would vet proposals.
3. Once the deadline is reached there would be a 24hour period where any last minute submissions would be reviewed by ICC as well as sort them by Genre
4. All submissions would then be revealed, opening the Forums for discussion, debate, and voting. There would be a 2 week period where only a select number of games with greatest community support per genre and/or Genre status would advance.
   - During IPJ announcement the IMC will defined these parameters
5. Winners of select categories would then have a pitch contest for both the community and IMC/Committee.
6. The IMC/Committee would then select 1 or several winner(s) that would win in the Illuvium Pitch Jam. These games would then be placed in the holding pool for the Game Review Board. Placements for the other games would also be determined and any rewards would be distributed accordingly.

### Game Review Board: 
1. All games currently in the Holding pool would provide an extended pitch to the Review Board. 
2. The IMC would then have a period of time(x Days) consulting the viability with the committees and the studio. The studio may request an extension to do Prototyping and testing to get a better understanding of the scope of such a project.
3. After that period the team would present findings and suggestions for such a game to the IMC. A super majority is required to approve the eventual build of said game. The game would then be added to the end of the production queue. 
   - In the event that there are several games in the queue and a stakeholder feels that the order should be different There will be a process in which the community can propose a change to the queue up until the team has announced they have officially started. 

### Special considerations:
1. In the following two situations sponsors can provide additional information if they are wanting to develop the game using the Illuvim Brand, requesting a position on the team to build sponsored game and/or other special considerations such as NDAs and partnership terms and conditions. 
   - External organizations Studios: These partnerships can be potentially hard to navigate. It should be expected that all terms and conditions will not be publicly available, but we should not limit the potential growth of illuvium by forcing all the details in the open. Due to this nature, it is suggested these pitches are not submitted in the illuvium Pitch Jam path as they may have to compete with more visible community driven ideas.
   - Sponsors who request the opportunity to be the creative director(or hold a different role within illuvium labs) or have other requirements of the game they pitched will be able to state that in the questionnaire and Illuvium labs will reach out separately. 
2. Any public information from the pitch that is presented is required to be their own work. The sponsor will not have any rights to the IP they present. Official terms and Conditions will have to be accepted in the questionnaire that is vetted by Illuvium Legal team. 

## Appendix A: Illuvium Game Pitch Proposal(IGPP)
This document will include key concepts and deliverables of the game pitch. 

## Appendix B: Pitch Deck
Would provide information on pitch expectations and requirements

## Appendix C: Game Evaluation Spreadsheet 
This is a subjective scoring sheet that will provide a place for the sponsor to explain why it rates high in key categories. These will provide good conversation points in the Forums 

### Evaluation Criteria
Here is some of the criteria a sponsor may evaluate for their pitch:
- Market Size: Estimated number of players or revenue generated by games in this genre.
- Asset Reusability: The feasibility and impact of reusing current assets from illuvium.
- Blockchain Integration Potential: How well the game can integrate with blockchain features like tokenization, smart contracts, etc.
- IP Enhancement: The potential of the genre to add value to your studio's Intellectual Property.
= Competition: Degree of saturation and competition in the market for this genre.
- Innovation: A rating based on innovative mechanics that have not been seen in similar games of the genre
- Epoch 9 council will set up exact requirements and sponsors may add additional categories they feel would be worth showcasing and explaining

## Conclusion:
Once this IIP is approved the IMC would have the authority to request Pre-Planning Genre Research and Genre analysis documents when they feel it is time to start considering the next game. The DAO as a whole will understand how to pitch new game ideas and have a clear picture of the future and how illuvium will expand its IP.
